# Task 10: Demonstrate List Slicing

# Step 1: Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Step 2: Extract the first five elements from the list
first_five = numbers[:5]

# Step 3: Reverse these extracted elements
reversed_first_five = first_five[::-1]

# Step 4: Print both the extracted list and the reversed list
print(f"Extracted first five elements: {first_five}")
print(f"Reversed extracted elements: {reversed_first_five}")
